# BlackBerry&reg; WebWorks&trade; JavaScript API Documentation

This repository previously held source code for all of the BlackBerry WebWorks API documentation. To minimize confusion during the transition from WebWorks 1.0 to WebWorks 2.0, the source code for the documentation has been removed. 

Documentation is available on the [BlackBerry Developer Docs website](http://developer.blackberry.com/html5/) for [WebWorks 1.0 APIs](http://developer.blackberry.com/html5/apis/v1_0/) and [WebWorks 2.0 APIs](http://developer.blackberry.com/html5/apis/v2_0/). To make an update to either set of documentation, leave a comment on the relevant page and it will be fixed as soon as possible.

BlackBerry WebWorks remains an Open Source project.
