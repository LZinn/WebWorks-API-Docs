# BlackBerry&reg; WebWorks&trade; JavaScript API Documentation

This repository previously held source code for all of the BlackBerry WebWorks API documentation. To minimize confusion during the transition from WebWorks 1.0 to WebWorks 2.0, the source code for the API documentation has been removed. 

API documentation for both WebWorks 1.0 and WebWorks 2.0 is available on the [BlackBerry HTML5 WebWorks website](http://developer.blackberry.com/html5/). To make an update, leave a comment on the relevant page and it will be fixed as soon as possible.

BlackBerry WebWorks remains an Open Source project.
